# Learning-VisualBasic
To save the projects I made in Visual Basic for learning purpose. Related to the telecom company ETECSA, currently working for (web scrapping using Visual Basic, processing data, build tables and generate Word documents automatically)

These files go inside a Workbook of Microsoft Excel, the description, comments and variables usually are in spanish.
  There's one who uses the Microsoft Library "Microsoft XML, v6.0", these library contains classes and methods to communicate using methods HTTP, the code authenticate in a web, 
  goes to the list section, and download the information of the web contained in the variables that represents the states of the tickets "estados" and the date of the tickets "fechaInicioDesde"
  and "fechaInicioHasta". The code was created with the help of web developper tools in firefox and google chrome; scanning the section "Network" to see the communication needed of HTTP.
  This code will only work inside the corporate network of ETECSA (cuban internet service provider).

  The other code will check all the alarms on a file (which is exported by a system), process all the alarms and calculating the total duration data of each Alarm per equip. It will construct
  multiple tables in Excel to watch all the alarms classificated in the severity of each Alarm.
